## Architecture

```
Frontend (React + Vite)  →  Netlify CDN
         │
         │  REST API (HTTPS)
         ▼
Backend (Express + TypeScript)  →  Render
         │
         ├── Prisma → PostgreSQL (Neon)
         │
         └── BullMQ → Redis (Upstash)

## Features

- Create and manage workflows with custom steps and routing rules
- Step types: `task`, `approval`, `notification`
- Rule-based routing using jexl expressions evaluated against execution input
- Async execution via BullMQ job queue
- Real-time execution tracking with step-by-step timeline
- Audit log with full execution history
- Cancel, retry, and delete executions
- Fully responsive — works on mobile and desktop

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Neon PostgreSQL database — [https://neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
- Upstash Redis instance — [https://upstash.com](https://upstash.com)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and install all dependencies
git clone https://github.com/harenguru/Workflow_Automation_System.git
cd Workflow_Automation_System
npm run install:all
```

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<db>?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<db>?sslmode=require
REDIS_URL=rediss://:<password>@<host>:<port>
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

> The `.env` file is not committed. Contact harenguruv@gmail.com for credentials.

### Database Setup

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma db push
npx prisma db seed
cd ..
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts three processes concurrently:

| Process | Description | Port |
|---------|-------------|------|
| API | Express backend | 3000 |
| Worker | BullMQ job processor | — |
| UI | Vite dev server | 5173 |

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Rule Engine

Rules are jexl expressions evaluated against the execution's input data. Rules are checked in priority order — first match wins.

Supported operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `&&`, `||`

Use `DEFAULT` as the condition to always match (fallback rule).

```
Input: { "amount": 250, "department": "Engineering" }

Priority 1 → "amount > 500"   → false, skip
Priority 2 → "amount > 100"   → true  → route to next step
Priority 3 → "DEFAULT"        → skipped
```

---

## Execution Lifecycle

```
pending → in_progress → completed
                      → failed    (retryable)
                      → canceled
```

- Failed executions can be retried (creates a new run with `retries + 1`)
- Pending/in-progress executions can be canceled
- Engine stops after 50 iterations to prevent infinite loops

---

## Sample Workflows

### 1. Expense Approval

Input fields: `amount` (number), `country` (string), `priority` (High/Medium/Low), `department` (string)

| Condition | Route |
|-----------|-------|
| `amount > 100 && country == "US" && priority == "High"` | Manager Approval → Finance Notification → Task Completion |
| `amount > 5000` (after Finance) | Finance Notification → CEO Approval → Task Completion |
| `amount <= 100 \|\| department == "HR"` | Manager Approval → CEO Approval → Task Completion |
| `priority == "Low" && country != "US"` | Manager Approval → Task Rejection |

### 2. Employee Onboarding

Input fields: `department` (string), `seniority` (string), `employee_name` (string)

| Condition | Route |
|-----------|-------|
| `department == "engineering" && seniority == "senior"` | Initial Review → Engineering Onboarding → Manager Approval → Welcome Email |
| `department == "engineering"` (other seniority) | Initial Review → Engineering Onboarding → Welcome Email |
| any other department | Initial Review → General Onboarding → Welcome Email |
